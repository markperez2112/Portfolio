ESET369 Embedded Systems Software:

In this project, the user is allowed to enter a temperature in fahrenheit through the PUTTY interface.
The program, which was developed using C language, will then power on the DC fan to cool the temperature sensor to the user-desired temperature while updating the user with the current temperature of the system until their desired temperature is reached.
