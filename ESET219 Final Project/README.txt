ESET219 Digital Electronics:

This robot was constructed by myself in order to follow a track placed on the floor, which had a current running through it. 
The sensors attached to the vehicle would detect the current and alter its motion in order to stay on the track and complete the course. 
This was developed using State Machines, MultiSim Programming, and the BASYS3 Microcontroller.
