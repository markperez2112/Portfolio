The DSTR Robotic Vehicle was constructed by Roland Alaniz and myself and was constructed with the inclusion of an infrared sensor in order to allow for the robotic vehicle to have obstacle detection.
This was accomplished using C Programming through Keil, the MSP432 Microcontroller, and the L298N motor driver attached to the DSTR robotic vehicle, in which the program was set to allow the vehicle to move forward until the infrared sensor detected an object and at that point it would halt its motion.
On a real-world scale, many vehicle today have these safety features such as automatic breaking when obstacles are detected such as the car breaking when detecting a vehicle while driving in reverse, and our project accomplishes this on smaller scale.
