ESET269 Embedded Systems Development in C:

This is a mock password system that was developed using the buttons found on the MSP432 microcontroller. 
The video shows multiple attempts to guess the password, which was 2112. 
If the wrong passcode was entered, the device would flash red indicating an incorrect input, but the right input would show the green LED on to indicate a correct input and let the user try again after a specific amount of time.
