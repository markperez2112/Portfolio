ESET 359 Electronic Instrumentation:

The DSTR Robotic Vehicle used in this project was built in a previous semesters project and modified in this project in order to allow for the control of the motors using pulses from ones forearm muscle contractions. 
This was done through the use of electrode pads connected to the user's forearm, in which the signal is obtained via a heartrate sensor and amplified before being obtained through the NI DAQ module. 
The software behind the control of the motors was completed through LabVIEW in order to read in the signal from the DAQ and send an output signal to control the motors based on the input from the electrode pads.
