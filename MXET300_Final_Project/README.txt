The Sensing, Connected Utility Transport Taxi for Level Environments (SCUTTLE) robot shown in the project was constructed over the course of the semester. Each lab introduced the various components of the SCUTTLE, which included the assembly of the chassis and its main hardware components, testing the motors and encoders, as well as integrating the LIDAR and Computer Vision Webcam onto our robot. 
As part of our final project, we chose to develop a program that would allow for our SCUTTLE robot to follow a color coordinated path while detecting obstructions in its path as well as recognizing a stop sign and stopping for a predetermined amount of time. Each of these tasks implemented the various sensors we had previously worked with. In terms of the path following and stop sign detection, we used the webcamera to detect and follow the path as well as detect the stop sign and stop for a period of 5 seconds to mimick a motor vehicle.
In terms of the obstacle detection, we used the LIDAR sensor mounted to the front of the camera in order to detect obstacles within our set distance from the SCUTTLE, and the robot was programmed to halt its motion until the obstacle was no longer in the path of the robot.

In the link below, you will find a visual representation of the SCUTTLE robot during our last testing phases, which show the SCUTTLE following the track we constructed in the lab as well as it stopping for the stop sign as well as any obstacles that were placed in its way.
